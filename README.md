- 👋 Hi, I’m @razafy-rindra
- 👀 I’m interested in all things mathematics! More specifically, you will probably see me writing about Algebraic geometry and Visualising Maths.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my master's at UAlberta. You may find lecture notes here, but also occasionally some Rust projects and some notes on various textbooks.

In front of the ocean of mathematics, we are tasked with finding the islands of truth.
In our eternal voyage we must heed Hilbert's epitaph: We must know — we will know.
